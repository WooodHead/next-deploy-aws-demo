# Next Deploy AWS Demo

This is a demo of [Next Deploy](https://github.com/lone-cloud/next-deploy).

It is almost a copy of the [Next.js with-typescript example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-typescript) except an extra `index-ssr` page was added to demo the deployment capability.

Much of the deployment configuration can be found in the `next.config.js` file.

The deployed app can be viewed at https://d1glu8cqlkaas6.cloudfront.net
